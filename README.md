# Just a Random RPG Project
This is a random project that I decided to pursue. It's an attempt at can I go further with an random RPG generator.
The project will be similiar to DnD, but isn't exact due to the fact that I haven't checked out the rules and everything and I can't make guarantees.

And lastly... In RNG we trust.
